Final week of this course. I plan to finish the data project next week and prioritise my other work this week.
Interesting stuff added on retrospectively:
1. My dataset is actually really good and the fact that I was able to add CPI data makes it even better because it helps analyse trends related to metrics that track our economy.
2. It's interesting researching the important parts of the visualisations I create. For example, I never knew that Perth housing prices were really high relative to other capital cities in the 2000s. See that in the visualisation led me to research why and find out it was due to the booming mining sector. These bits of research that complemented the data were really interesting.
