Got started on the data project this week. Overall, the exercises were very intuitive. Did get a little confused as I made a typo and was failing a test due to an extra space, however, was able to work that out quickly using the debugger!

Currently, I'm doing some more research in time for next week so that I can work on my data project earlier rather than later. Looking into different metrics that will support my hypothesis along with the housing data I am analysing.
